# Algorithms Python
 This repository contains a collection of sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for common algorithms used in computer science and to help developers improve their problem-solving skills.  The repository includes various sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort, and searching algorithms, such as linear search, binary search, and interpolation search. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and includes detailed comments and explanations for better understanding. Developers can use this repository to learn about different sorting and searching algorithms and to implement them in their own projects.  Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged!
